Revenue leakage and margin visibility
AI can track and reconcile freight, warehouse, and transportation costs automatically across systems like Business Central, SCALE, and vendor feeds. It can spot unbilled revenue, duplicate charges, and margin erosion in near real time.
2.	Labor and asset utilization
AI can forecast labor needs and equipment usage by site and customer. That means reducing overtime, rental costs, and downtime while improving productivity.
3.	Customer forecasting and pricing discipline
Using shipment patterns, seasonality, and external data (fuel, lane congestion, etc.), AI can predict customer demand and recommend optimal pricing and inventory strategies helping protect margins and improve contract renewals.
